    <Remarks>Shade-tolerant; slow-growing; moderately long-lived.  Typically found in northern swamps where it is an important winter food source for deer and rabbits.  Also survives on dry, limestone soils.  Live lower branches sprout roots and form new trees when covered by soil or plant litter.  Rot-resistant wood often used for fence posts, roof shingles, and fire by frictions kits.  The name arborvitae, meaning "tree of life", is traced to the early French explorer Jacques Cartier whose crew was saved from scurvy by a tea brewed from the tree's vitamin C-rich foliage and twigs</Remarks>
