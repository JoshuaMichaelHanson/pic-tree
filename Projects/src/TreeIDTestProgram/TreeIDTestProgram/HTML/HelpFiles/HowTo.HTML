				PicTree is a easy to use tree
				identification application.  Start
				by looking at the tree and determine
				if it is deciduous or coniferous.  If
				you are unable to do that please read
				the help on those topics.  You can also
				just click the browse tree option and 
				look for the tree you are trying to id.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				After you pick the type you will see a
				part or parts of the tree to look at
				under the small PicTree.  For example
				if you pick deciduous you will see
				leaves.  Then two choices with a small
				description above the picture.  Look at
				the part of the tree in this case the 
				leaves.  Are they opposite or whorled
				or are they alternate.  Again if you
				dont know a term or need more help pick
				the question mark.  Some options have
				multiple parts of the tree to look at
				for example Fruit/Number Leaflets/Type/
				Twig Film.  Examine the tree and pick
				the best choice.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				Once you get to a tree you will see
				pictures and you can scroll down and
				left and right to see more.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
				You will see a flag next to the
				question mark.  This can be used to
				take you to the home screen.
