    <Remarks>Malus species like other trees and shrubs should not be planted into living sod.  The site should be prepared a year ahead so that early spring plantings can be made into weed free locations that are two feet larger in radius than the seedlings.  Nursery seedlings of the species discussed above should be planted as early in the spring as possible.  Grafted varieties are usually purchased as container plants.  When planted, the graft must be above ground.  Do not fertilize during the establishment year.  Prune off all side branches that are not desired for permanent limbs, and provide protection from rabbits and deer in high population areas.</Remarks>
