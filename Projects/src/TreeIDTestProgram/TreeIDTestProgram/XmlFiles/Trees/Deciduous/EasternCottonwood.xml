    <Remarks>Cottonwood makes its best growth on moist, well-drained, fine sandy loams or silt loams.  Coarse sands and heavy clay soils are not satisfactory.  It has been found to be relatively tolerant of drier sites as shown by survival and growth of trees planted on strip mine spoil.  Many seedless and columnar-shaped varieties exist.</Remarks>
