    <Remarks>The ancient Greeks knew the therapeutic values of willow.  Tea made from willow bark was used for stiff joints and rheumatic pains.  By the 1840’s, chemists had isolated salicylic acid from willow and found it produced marked antipyretic (fever-reducing) and analgesic (pain-killing) effects and “striking relief of acute articular rheumatism.”  Modern aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is a synthetic product.  Salicylic acid got its name from Salix.  The willows are among the first plants to provide honey bees, after long winters, with nectar and pollen.</Remarks>
