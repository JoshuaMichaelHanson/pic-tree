    <Remarks>Early valued for its bark, an important source of tannin for the leather industry.  American Indians used the cambium as the base for breads and soups or mixed it with dried fruit and animal fat for pemmican.  Natives and white settlers made tea from hemlock leaves, which are high in vitamin C.  Most shade tolerant of all tree species and may remain in the understory for 25-400 years.  May start to produce cones at 15 years of age.</Remarks>
